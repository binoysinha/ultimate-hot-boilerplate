ultimate-hot-boilerplate for a universal react/node app with server-side-render

This boilerplate come with common things you can found in [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), while being more progressive in adopting some of the more edgy stacks, such as styled-components, redux-segment, graphql, flow, prettier, etc.

It can be used as the base of a monolithical app that packs UI and API all together for rapid iterations or products or being split up into micro-services as well.
